# LARGE ROOM ATTACKERS

## About

Written using the HTML5 canvas, JavaScript and some (minimal) css, this is a fun and simple implementation of the arcade classic.

## Playing

Open `index.html` up in a browser and go to town!

## Editing

### For novices: 

Edit the file `js/config.js` and changing those variables will let you influence much of the game play 

### For those wanting a challenge:

Edit the file `js/index.js`, look through the comments and make some changes. Refresh your browser and see them in action!
