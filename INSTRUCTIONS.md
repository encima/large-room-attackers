# Introduction

Use the README file to run the game

Play it for a few minutes to understand the objects being used and the dynamics of the game.

# Exercises

1. Look at `js/config.js` and edit the numbers to see what changes in the game. Try and:
	* Add more enemy ships
	* Make the player ship bigger
	* Make the enemy ships slower
	* Make the player ship faster
	* Change the colour of the bullets 

2. Look in the `js/index.js` file and look for a laser variable that has been commented out. Try uncommenting it and finding the line where it plays (HINT: Space key shoots on `buttonDown`)

3. Try changing the sound to a different mp3 downloaded from the web and copied into the `audio` folder

4. Find a way to score the most without just setting a high start score

5. Try and change the speed of the enemy bullets 

6. Whatever else you want to do, ask us and we can help
